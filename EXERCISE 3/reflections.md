# Stack and Queue Reflections

## Stack Reflection
A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. It is not suitable for handling customers waiting in order because the last customer to arrive would be the first to be served, which is unfair and does not respect the order of arrival. In real-life scenarios like queues at banks or service centers, serving the last person first would cause dissatisfaction and chaos.

## Queue Reflection
A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. It matches the fairness principle in events because the first person to arrive is the first to be served. This ensures order, fairness, and satisfaction among participants, making it ideal for managing lines in public places, ticket counters, and other similar situations.
